     		<h2 class="origin">Origin:</h2>
		 			<p class="definition">The idea for the clothing line "Free Kings" came from a rather unorthodox setting. One night my older brother and I were on the phone talking about life like we regularly do. My brother, Alfred Robinson, got on the topic of the famous basketball player Lebron James. My brother told me how the media often refers to him as "King James." He also started to indicate how there were many other great kings in our society. I replied, "What if they really live like a king?" However, those kings had many problems and issues. We pondered on "What would a king be without dilemmas?" for about ten minutes until the idea emerged. We later defined a Free King as having the right or power to be free and having the ability to live your life with the controller.</p>

            <p class="alfredcreator">Greetings, my name is Alfred Robinson. I am the founder of the clothing line "Free Kings." Cinque and I grew up in Florence, Alabama with our five other siblings. Growing up with other siblings was very ehausting, but my parents persuaded me even harder that I am in control of my life. I eventually realized that when I graduated college at Remington College, and majored in heating/air conditioning technology. I am a very hard working person that doesn't stop until I reach that goal. One of my goals for this clothing line is to help other people understand that you can have control of the choices you make in your life.</p>
